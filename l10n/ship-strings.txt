# Sylverant ship server translation file -- Master strings list.
# Each line starts with a string in English from the source code. This should be
# followed by a pipe character (|) then the string in the destination language of
# the translation.
#
# Some notes about the translation file format:
#
# All files should be UTF-8. Note that this will be changed to the appropriate
# encoding internally by the server. For PSOPC and PSOBB clients, that would be
# UTF-16 Little Endian, and for PSODC and PSOGC it will either be Shift-JIS
# (for Japanese) or ISO-8859-1 (all other languages). Please make sure that all
# characters you use can be represented in the appropriate encoding.
#
# If a pipe character is needed in the string, escape it with a slash
# (so like this: \|). There are additionally other characters that are able
# to be done with escapes, such as horizontal tab (\t) and newline (\n).
#
# Throughout the strings, you'll see sequences like \tE and \tC4. These are
# flags to PSO. \tE sets the encoding for non-Japanese. \tC4 sets the color to
# (in the case of the 4) red. Please keep the colors as-is for consistency
# across translations. However, for Japanese strings, you will need to replace
# \tE with \tJ in your translated versions. For the other versions, just copy
# these flags over untouched if you see them.
#
# Comments begin with a # character and span the rest of the line.
#
# Blank lines are ignored.
#
# Strings are only listed in the first file they appear in (at the time of the
# creation of the list).
